# Description
A basic template for dashboard layouts.

# Tests

# Start
```bash
npm start
```

```bash
npm test
```

# Configuration
Filepaths are defined with cra-alias, since babel support is complicated.
Modify the jsconfig.json file to set up your own routes.

**!!!IMPORTANT!!!** 

Update your package.json to use `cra-alias` instead of `react-native`

# Update Theme Color
The theme color is configured in `./src/App/App.styles.js` of the project directory.

# Data imports
Data is currently held locally in `./src/Resources/json`
